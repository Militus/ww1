 BATTEN_DOWN_THE_HATCHES_NAME:0 "Batten down the Hatches"
 BATTEN_DOWN_THE_HATCHES_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, the Franco-Prussian War has allowed Germany to become the leading force, creating a lust for the expansion of the Fatherland beyond Europe. Russia's industrialization has led to a mass influx of Leninist ideas within the nation. Britain and France prepare themselves for another next war in Europe, while the Ottoman Empire continues to dwell in a state of decay, allowing Italy to lay claims to the Ottoman lands in Africa. The Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia has caused lots of tension in Europe. Could this be the spark to light the Balkan Tinderbox?"
 ENG_BATTEN_DOWN_THE_HATCHES_DESC:0 "Over the past century, the glorious British Empire has spanned across the entire world, generating mass amounts of industry, trade, resources, and manpower for the Home Islands.With her massive navy to control the sea, and her powerful army to conquer the land, Britain is a near unstoppable force. With the most influence around the world, many nations have felt the touch of the British Empire, falling under her in ways in the process. However, they are bound to their tradition, and often stick to their conservative ways. Will they be able to keep up with these modern times?"
 FRA_BATTEN_DOWN_THE_HATCHES_DESC:0 "As the bitter loser of the Franco-Prussian War, France has been on the path to try and overcome German superiority in Europe. The loss of Alsace-Lorraine has created an influx of revanchism in the French people and the lust for revenge over the Germany. The continued economic and industrial growth has put France near the top of the major powers of Europe, the colonization and developement of West Africa and Indo-China grants access to a plethora of resources. France is soon to delve into a brutal war. Will the Third Republic be able to beat the threat on the horizon, or will she be overpowered by her enemies?"
 GER_BATTEN_DOWN_THE_HATCHES_DESC:0 "Für das Vaterland! The German Empire leads Europe into a modern tomorrow! After their astounding success in the Franco-Prussian War, Germany has been the best industrially, economically, and militarily. Along with their success in Europe came the colonization of Africa and Oceania, bringing in an opportunity for further expansion. It seems that nothing can bring down the Kaiserreich!"
 ITA_BATTEN_DOWN_THE_HATCHES_DESC:0 "The newest major nation in Europe, Italy formed in 1861 under the current King Victor Emmanuel III. While weak militarily and economically, Italy hold lots of potential to become a strong nation. While late to the colonization game, Italy controls Somaliland and Eritrea. King Victor now sets his sights on Libya. It should be easy enough to take. Or will it?"
 TUR_BATTEN_DOWN_THE_HATCHES_DESC:0 "Nicknamed "The Sick Man of Europe", the Ottoman Empire has been in decline for the past 200 years. While losing their influence in Europe and Africa, they struggle to maintain what land they have left. With a bit of modernization, the Ottoman Empire may be able to return to its former glory."
 SOV_BATTEN_DOWN_THE_HATCHES_DESC:0 "The vast Russian Empire is heading down a dark path. With Tsar Nicholas II failing as a leader, Communist and Democratic ideas start to ake their way into the Russian people. While not fully modernized, Russia is still a force to be reckoned with. The beginning of the twentieth century is a time of great change for Russia. One simple event just has to start it."
 AUS_BATTEN_DOWN_THE_HATCHES_DESC:0 "An empire of many cultures, Austria-Hungary has claimed much of the Balkans as their own. The recent annexation of Bosnia from the Ottoman Empire has caused much tension in Europe. With a plethora of cultures comes a plethora of problems. Separatist groups refuse to cooperate and are threatening the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, the Empire shall remain strong! Right?"
 OTHER_BATTEN_DOWN_THE_HATCHES_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France has been on the road to recovery thanks to a strong economy. However, the Depression has still affected the country and the new German regime has no interest in paying the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWhen the treaty was signed, a French marshal famously remarked that it was not peace, but an armistice of 20 years. Those 20 years are now rapidly running out."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new Germany has risen. Three years have passed since the Weimar Republic was dismantled and replaced by Hitler's Third Reich. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the Great Depression, and mass unemployment has been dealt with.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty are long forgotten, and the Wehrmacht grows stronger by the day. Another Weltkrieg is on the horizon."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
